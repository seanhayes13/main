# Address Book

This section contains most of the files for a simple address book (minus the database connection PHP file, and obviously the
database itself). 

There are seperate files for adding, deleting, and viewing entries. When viewing an entry, there is the option to add 
additional information for contacts. This is useful when someone has multiple email addresses or phone numbers, or when you want
to track both home and work mailing addresses.
