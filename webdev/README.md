# Web Development
HTML, CSS, JS, PHP

This repository contains a small collection of various projects that I am working on for web development.
Most of the files and samples on here are written in PHP instead of just HTML since using PHP allows for
using template code across multiple pages.

I am slowly loading some of the code I am using into here so keep checking back for more.

### Sections Loaded So Far:

  * [Address Book](addressbook)
    * A simple address book for names, addresses, phone numbers, and emails
  * [Caesar Cipher](caesarcipher)
    * A Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption program
  * [Movie Database](moviedatabase)
    * Populate Movie/Actor intermediate table using PHP

For live examples of many of these, visit my web site at www.runninmancoding.com
