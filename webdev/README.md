# Web Development
HTML, CSS, JS, PHP

This repository contains a small collection of various projects that I am working on for web development.
Most of the files and samples on here are written in PHP instead of just HTML since using PHP allows for
using template code across multiple pages.

I am slowly loading some of the code I am using into here so keep checking back for more.

### Sections Loaded So Far:

  * [Address Book](addressBook)
    * A simple address book for names, addresses, phone numbers, and emails
  * [Caesar Cipher](caesarCipher)
    * A Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption program
  * [codepen.io](http://codepen.io/seanhayes/#)
    * A collection of pages built while working through FreeCodeCamp's classes.
      * A [Tribute Page](http://codepen.io/seanhayes/pen/QEBpJP) to any figure we chose
