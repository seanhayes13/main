# VetTalk.net

For the capstone project of my Bachelor's we had to develop a project as far as we could within 11 weeks (normally the capstone
is spread out over two terms of 11 weeks a piece but in this case the capstone was condensed to half the time). Our group decided
to use an SRS document one of us had developed for an online class and modify from a mobile application into a web based version.
The catch was that of the four people in our team I was one of three with any web development or SQL skills, and the only one with
any experience with PHP. So I knew I had my work cut out for me, good thing I like a challenge.

## The Idea

The basic idea behind the site was to provide a means for Veterans to reach out to a representative of at the Veteran's Affairs
with basic questions. Yes, there may be similar tools maintained by the VA but the goal behind this was to make a simpler version.
In theory, a Veteran would register on the site and submit questions. A representative at the VA would be able to review the 
question and provide the answer. Other Veterans would be able to view answered questions if the original poster made the question 
public. Questions could be sorted by state and/or topic.
