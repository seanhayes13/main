# Main Repository

If you saw the old system of repositories, this is set up the same just everything in one file. The big reason I put everything in one folder like this is so that I could see the code ratio bar at the top comparing how much of each type of code I have loaded.

Some of these sections have more code than others since I am slowly uploading the programs a little bit at a time. Keep checking back for new updates. If there is something that I've created a bookmark for and haven't uploaded, let me know and I will try to put it near the top of my list for next programs to load.
