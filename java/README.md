# Java

This is a small collection of Java programs that I have written either for classes or on my own for small side projects.
Since I am currently working on loading code for multiple sections (see below for links to those other sections) it will
take me a little time to upload everything, so keep checking back for more.

### Sections Loaded So Far:

  * [Battleship](battleship)
    * The final project for a recent Java course
  * [Caesar Cipher](caesarcipher)
    * A Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption program
  * [Distributed Processing](distributedProcessing)
    * A simple proof of concept for a distributed processing program using multithreading
  * [File Backup](fileBackUp)
    * A tool I wrote to help backup code files from multiple locations at once
  * [FileCabinet](fileCabinet)
    * A crude attempt to write an object database similar to MongoDB
  * [Snippet Manager](snippetMgr)
    * A program that stores bits of code, tags, language, and notes
