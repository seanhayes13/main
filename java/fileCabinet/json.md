 # Working with JSON

So if you are reading this after reading the previous posting, I was working with just grabbing every node in
a drawer then saving all of those as one list, and then processing each of those nodes and building pages. Ugly.
Thankfully, I adjusted the code to save each drawer in its entirety and keeping the same structure (was actually
easier than I thought it would be).
