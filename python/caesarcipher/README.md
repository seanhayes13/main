# Caesar Cipher

This is a program that I've written in [C*#*](https://github.com/seanhayes13/csharp/caesarcipher), 
[Java](https://github.com/seanhayes13/java/caesarcipher), and [JavaScript](https://github.com/seanhayes13/webdev/saesarcipher)
so check those out for other approaches I've taken.

Python was the second attempt at writing this program, it is a bit more complicated than the C*#* version and I'm thinking
about reworking this to make it simpler but that is near the bottom of the list of things to do.
