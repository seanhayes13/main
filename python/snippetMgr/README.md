# Snippet Manager

This is a program written for one of my college classes that allows users to save snippets of code for retrieval later on. Along with the code itself, the following information can also be saved:

- The language to code is written in
- Any tags you the user wants to associate with the code
  - I plan to include a tag search feature at some point
- Notes about the code to remind yourself

I will be uploading the code and a walk through of it later on
