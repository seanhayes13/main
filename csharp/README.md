# C#

This is a small collection of various programs and bits of code written in C#.
I'm picking up this language currently so new bits of code will come a little slower than my other
sections.

### Sections Loaded So Far:

    * A refactored version of a Java program
  * [Caesar Cipher](/caesarcipher)
    * A Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption program
